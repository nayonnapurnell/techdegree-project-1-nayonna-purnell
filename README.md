# The Random Quote Generator Project

### Software Developer: Nayonna Purnell

This project is a random quote generator, which displays quotations on a page, and can be controlled by the user. 

This build is my first JavaScript application for this Treehouse Techdegree.

1. Create an array of 5 Quote Objects.
2. Create the getRandomQuote function that passes in the quotes object to return a randomQuote.
3. Create the printQuote function so that when a user presses the Get quote button, a new quote appears on the screen.
